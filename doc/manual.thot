====== Introduction ======

ElfMake is the result of my frustation in the use of GnuMake,
CMake and AutoTools. There are lots of alternatives tools (particularly
for GnuMake) like Scons, AAP, Ant, etc but they don't maintain
the brilliant of recipes (also known as rules).

A recipe is formed of three components:
  * the target files that the products of the rule,
  * the dependency files that the targets are build from,
  * the action that performs the build of the target from the dependencies.

The concept is very simple: if the targets are older than the depedencies,
the action is executed and must build the target files using the dependency files.
Such a simple is very beautiful because it's enough to represent most building
process of most applications including executables, static and dynamic libraries
and anything where exists transforming program on files. But most alternatives
to GnuMake dropped such a treasure.

Yet, GnuMake (and its ancestors) has two main drawbacks:
  * unefficient solving process of generic recipes causing combinatory explosion of file lookup,
  * inadequate script layer that makes the task of building automatically recipes exceedingly hard and non-modular.

ElfMake try to solve both problems while keeping the concept of generic recipes.
The first issue is solved by reducing the domain of lookup for automatic recipes:
only dependency strings between a source file and its final object are considereed.
The second issue is simply achieved using Python as the script system.
Fortunately, Python alone is not enough and ElfMake provides lots of common facilities
to create and control recipes.

About building systems like CMake or BuildTools, the integration inside
ElfMake comes from the easy statement that there is no reason to separate
building configuration and building itself. Moreover, the building scripts,
where programs and sources are defined, have a better knowledge of what is
done and therefore can identify which are the requirements for building
the application.


====== Simple Recipe ======

===== Hello, World! =====

Let's start with the very classic "Hello, World" example. With your
prefered editor, create a file named ''hello.c'' and enter its content:

<code c>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	puts("Hello, World!");
	return 0;
}
</code>

Our goal is to generate an executable for our program. With ElfMake,
just create a new file named ''make.py'' with the following content:

<code py>
from elfmake import *
from elfmake import c

c.program("hello", ["hello.c"])
</code>

To launch the building of the program, just type:
<code sh>
> python make.py
</code>

The following output will appear meaning that the building is successful:
<code>
 cc  -o hello.o -c hello.c
 cc  -o hello hello.o 
</code>

As no error is displayed, compulation is successful and you can test your first program:
<code>
>./hello
Hello, World!
</code>

Now, you can modify your source ''hello.c'' or add new source file to your program,
you have just to invoke ''python make.py'' to get your program re-compiled and,
of course, only the modified sources are re-compiled. But you make things
a bit more automatic. Add in front of ''make.py'' the line:

<code py>
#!/usr/bin/python
</code>

And make this file executable:
<code>
chmod +x make.py
</code>

Then, the make process is simply restarted by:
<code sh>
> ./make.py
</code>


===== Goals =====

Previous section has exposed how ElfMake is able to build C program.
This is a default behaviour but, in the standard configuration, ElfMake
can perform several tasks, also named //goals//:
  * ''all'' is the default applied goal and build what is required,
  * ''clean'' removes all temporaries files like object files,
  * ''config'' builds the configuration,
  * ''distclean'' removes all produced files, i.e., object and executable files,
  * ''install'' performs the installation of files in the system, i.e. installation of ''hello'' in ''/usr/bin''.

To invoke a specific goal, just pass it as an argument in the command line:
<code sh>
> ./make.py clean
</code>

ElfMake represents the building process of an application as set of rules
made of three components (//targets//, //dependencies//, //actions//).
A rule means that, to build the //targets// files, we need first
the //dependencies// file and that the action //actions// (usually shell commands)
have to be performed. This allows creating a hierarchy between the different
actions to build the program and to only construct targets whose dependencies
changed.

The ''all'' goal belongs in fact to a rule whose dependencies are the set
of program to build. There is no action. When the ''all'' goal is invoked,
automatically all its dependencies, the programs, are built. But you may
also ask for the building of a program by specifying in the command line:
<code sh>
> ./make.py hello
</code> 


===== Customizing the compilation =====

==== Selecting a different build directory ====

Variable 'BPATH' is used to select in which directory to build files.
As a default, the build path is the top-level directory (containing the
main script). To change the build directory, one has to reconfigure
the project with a command like:
<code bash>
> ./make.py config BPATH=BUILD_DIRECTORY
</bash>

And to replace //BUILD_DIRECTORY// by the absolute or the relative path
to the build directory.

Anotehr way to customize the build directory after configuration
is to edit the file ''config.py'' and to add a line like:
<code python>
BPATH = "BUILD_DIRECTORY"
</code>


====== Environment Management ======

ElfMake work is based on the concept of environment: basically, an environment
is map associating symbols or identifier with values, this association
is called a variable. The values may
be any Python value but are usually strings or list of strings: this comes
from the fact that most actions are translated to calls to line commands.

In ElfMake, all objects are environments: files, script, etc. In addition,
the environment are stacked: each environment has as parent environment
the one where it is created. For files, the aprent environment is the one
of the script using the file. This stack is used to resolve variables
from the higher enviroment to the lower one in the stack. Therefore,
the script behaviour or variables are determined by the stack of script
including it providing a modular flavor to ElfMake. The lowest environment
is the OS variable environment meaning that the configuraton may be
provided by defining variable in your preferred shell.

To define a variable in your script environment is as easy as defined
a variable in a Python program:
<code python>
CC="my_c_compiler"
</code>

Unfortunately, accessing the environment stack is not as easy.
The code below:
<code python>
print "my compiler is %s" % CC
</code>
Will only resolve ''CC'' in the current environment (as usually in Python).
To use the stack of environment, you have to type:
<code python>
print "my compiler is %s" % get("CC")
</code>
In addition, you can also provide a default value as second argument:
<code python>
print "my compiler is %s" % get("CC", "cc")
</code>

To define the variable in the environment of a specific file, you can
use the ''file''() function:
<code python>
file("my_file.c")["CFLAGS"] = "-O2"
</code>

Finally, ElfMake provide explicit access to some environment information:
  * curenv -- current environment,
  * envstack -- stack of environment as a sequence.

If you use the ''env'' module:
<code python>
import elfmake.env as env
</code>

The following environment are available:
  * ''env.osenv'' -- environment representing OS variables,
  * ''env.elfenv'' -- environment contaning built-in definitions,
  * ''env.confenv'' -- environment containing the configuration,
  * ''env.topenv'' -- environment of the top-level script,
  * ''env.cenv'' -- current environment.


====== Configuration ======


====== Basic Commands and Variable ======

''elfmake'' Python package provides basic command and variable that
help the writing of scripts.

===== Environment Management =====

  * ''append''(//id//, //v//) -- append a value to an existing one.
  * ''curenv'' -- current environment (of the current script).
  * ''defined''(//id//) -- test if the identifier //id// is defined.
  * ''envstack'' -- stack of environment.
  * ''curdir'' -- current directory (of the current script).
  * ''get''(//id// [, //def//]) -- get a value of current environment.
  * ''pop_env''() -- pop the current environment.
  * ''push_env''(environment) -- push a new environment.
  * ''set''(//id//, //v//) -- set a variable in the current environment.
  * ''subdir''(//dir//) -- process script file of the given directory.


===== File Management =====

Resources to examine files includes:
  * ''file''(//path//) -- get ElfMake file matching the given path.
  * ''glob''(//RE//) -- select file list using the given path regular expression.
  * ''isdir''(//path//) -- test if given path designs a directory.
  * ''join''(//p1//, //p2//) -- join two paths according OS rules.
  * ''listdir''(//path//) -- build a list as the content of //path// directory.
  * ''path''(//path//) -- convert string to path.
  * ''suffix''(//path//) -- get extension of the file designed by the path.

Actions to work on files includes:
  * ''grep''(//RE//, //command//) -- execute given command and perform regular recognition on given output.
  * ''mkdir''(//path//) -- create the directory of the path.
  * ''remove''(//list//) -- remove directories and files of the list.

===== Goals and Rules =====

The following commands may be used to manage goals and rules:
  * ''goal''(//goal//, //deps//, //actions//) -- build a new goal (not matching a real file).
  * ''rule''(//ress//, //deps//, //actions//) -- build a specific rule for a particular file.

The following variables are used:
  * ''DESCRIPTION'' put on a goal file, provide description for the goal for option "-l".

===== Actions =====

In the previous goals and rules, actions may be object of type Action but also strings
that are automatically promoted as ''shell'' actions. Yet, other actions exists:

  * ''fun''(//function//) -- build an action like a call to the given function.
  * ''shell''(//commands//) -- build a a shell action.


====== Special Variables ======

  * ''BPATH'' -- path used to build files in (as default, the directory containing the script).



====== Standard Environment ======

The standard provides a consistant environment to let other modules
interact in a convenient. It is not mandatory (you can provide your own
standard module if needed) but this may make interaction with other modules
more difficult.

To use it:
<code python>
import elfmake.std as std
</code>

The standard module provides the following  goals:
  * ''all'' -- compiles all,
  * ''clean'' -- clean all produced files,
  * ''distclean'' -- clean all files including configuration and .pyc files,
  * ''config'' -- launch the configuration lookup.

These goals are using the following variables:
  * ''ALL'' -- list of targets to build,
  * ''CLEAN'' -- list of files to clean up,
  * ''DISTCLEAN'' -- list of files to clean in addition to ''CLEAN'',
  * ''INSTALL_PROGRAMS'' -- list of programs to install,
  * ''INSTALL_LIBS'' -- list of libraries to install,
  * ''INSTALL_DATA'' -- list of data files to install.


====== Standard Modules ======

===== C Module =====

The C module is dedicated to the compilation of C or C++ files. To use it:
<code python>
import elfmake.c as c
</code>

This module provides generator from .c, .cpp, .c++, .cxx or .C source files
to object .o files.

The following rules are available:
  * c.program(name, sources) -- build a C/C++ program from a list of sources.
  On Windows, .exe is added automatically to the program name.

This module uses the following variables to control the compilation:
  * ''CC'' -- C compiler, looked up at configuration (may be customized in script or source file),
  * ''CXX'' -- C++ compiled, look up at configuration (may be customized in script or in source file),
  * ''CFLAGS'' -- flags for C compilation (may be customized in script or in source file),
  * ''CXXFLAGS'' -- flags for C++ compilation (may be customized in script or in source file),
  * ''LDFLAGS'' -- link flags for C/C++ program building (may be customized in script or in program file).
